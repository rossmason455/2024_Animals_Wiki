                'description' => 'Lions (Panthera leo) are large, social carnivorous mammals known for their majestic appearance, particularly the males\' impressive manes, which can vary in color from blond to black. Weighing between 330 to 550 pounds (150 to 250 kg), they inhabit sub-Saharan Africa and the Gir Forest in India, primarily residing in savannas and grasslands. Lions live in groups called prides, typically consisting of related females, their cubs, and a few males, allowing them to hunt cooperatively and protect their young. They primarily prey on large herbivores like wildebeest and zebras, using teamwork to bring down their quarry. Classified as vulnerable, lions face declining populations due to habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching.',
                'behavioral_notes' => 'Lions (Panthera leo) are unique among big cats due to their social structure, living in groups called prides, which typically consist of several related females, their offspring, and one or two dominant males. They are cooperative hunters, often working together to take down large prey, with females usually doing most of the hunting using stealth and teamwork. Male lions are territorial and defend their prideâ€™s territory from rivals through roaring and scent marking. Communication is vital, with vocalizations like roars, grunts, and growls serving to establish dominance and location. Female lions play a crucial role in raising cubs, nursing and protecting them, while the pride may assist in caring for the young. Social interactions, including grooming, strengthen bonds and reduce tension, while playful interactions among cubs help develop their hunting skills. Known for their lazy behavior, lions can rest for up to 20 hours a day, conserving energy for effective hunting during cooler times. Although primarily found in savannas and grasslands, they can adapt to various environments as long as prey is available.',
